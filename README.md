# vim

Custom repository for my vim settings files.

Simply clone this repository, and copy the .vimrc file to wherever your shell looks for the file, typically
within your home directory, "~/".

If you do not use Vundle, you'll need to remove the Vundle specific lines from within the .vimrc.  Otherwise,
copy .vimvundle into the same directory as the .vimrc.

Cheers!

Then install process is really simple.  Just run the command below:

#### via curl
```shell
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/parker789/vim/master/install.sh)"
```

#### via wget
```shell
sh -c "$(wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/parker789/vim/master/install.sh)"
```
