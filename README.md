# vim

Custom repository for my vim settings files.

Simply clone this repository, and copy the .vimrc file to wherever your shell looks for the file, typically
within your home directory, "~/".

If you do not use Vundle, you'll need to remove the Vundle specific lines from within the .vimrc.  Otherwise,
copy .vimvundle into the same directory as the .vimrc.

Cheers!
